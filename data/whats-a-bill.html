<h3 class="h3">What's A Bill?</h3>

<p> The job of a Senator or a Representative is to make laws that uphold the spirit of the constitution. They can also amend or change the constitution itself. Senators and Representatives work on two documents: bills and resolutions.</p>

<p>A resolution conveys principles and sentiments of the Senate or the HOR. A bill, on the other hand, is a law in the making. These are the “proposed laws” or “proposed amendment” you hear about in the news, like House Bill No. 2379, which seeks to amend the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, the country’s 20-year-old tax code. House Bills are those made by a Representative, while Senate Bills are those made by a Senator.</p>
